# Artificial Intelligence-Pacman Game
Pacman Projects implementing various AI techniques

Pacman Projects apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics

This repository consists of following AI techniques implemented :
- Search (Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A* Search)
- MultiAgent (Adversarial and Stochastic Search, multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms)
- Ghostbusters (Probabilistic inference in a Hidden Markov Model tracking the movement of hidden ghosts in the pacman world)
- Classification (Machine learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes, Perceptron, MIRA models)
